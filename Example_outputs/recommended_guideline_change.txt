A caveat for usage of "Guideline 1: Provide Project-Specific Examples of Code Summaries and Context for functions/files" is the case where the repository contains files with differing levels of access.

If there is an internal file and an API file for it then the LLm can be prone to leaking internal details and creating semantically similar documentation for the two even if the access levels, contexts, and functionalities differ.

Thus I propose a new idea as a standalone guideline and an exception to guideline 1.

### Guideline 7:
Enfore strict separation between access levels of files, ideally using separate chats.


EXAMPLE:

A longer example can be found in example_long.txt. Below is a shorter demonstration on a single function:


PROMPT:
"
Our project's documentation style: pool_internal.h


Document this in pool.h
void pool_free(MemoryPool* pool, void* ptr);
"

GIVES:

/**
 * @brief Returns a previously allocated block to the pool.
 *
 * Returns a block previously obtained via pool_alloc() back to the pool for reuse.
 * If ptr is NULL the function does nothing. This function is thread-safe and
 * will acquire the pool's internal lock when updating pool state.
 *
 * @param pool Memory pool to return the block to (must be initialized via pool_init())
 * @param ptr Pointer previously returned by pool_alloc(), or NULL
 * @return None
 *
 * @pre pool initialized via pool_init(); if non-NULL, ptr must be a pointer
 *      previously returned by pool_alloc() and not already freed
 * @exceptsafe No-throw
 */

WHY THIS IS BAD:
False Details which are copied from pool_internal
Leaked details about the internal file


PROMPT:
"
Our project's documentation style: pool_internal.h

Document this in pool.h
void pool_free(MemoryPool* pool, void* ptr);

Note that pool_internal.h is an internal file and must not be leaked. Do not copy internal or implementation specific details.
"

GIVES: 

/**
 * @brief Return a previously allocated block to the pool.
 *
 * The block becomes available for future allocations. If ptr is NULL or does not
 * belong to the specified pool, the function has no effect.
 *
 * @param pool Memory pool to return the block to
 * @param ptr Pointer previously obtained from pool_alloc (may be NULL)
 * @return None
 *
 * @pre pool must be initialized via pool_init()
 * @exceptsafe No-throw guarantee
 */

WHY THIS IS BETTER:
Does not assume details about the similarly named function
Does not leak details about the internal file
