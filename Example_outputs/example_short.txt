Our project's documentation style: pool_internal.h


Document this in pool.h

/**

 * Returns a block previously obtained via pool_alloc() back to the pool for reuse.
 * If ptr is NULL the function does nothing. This function is thread-safe and

WHY THIS IS BAD:
False Details which are copied from pool_internal
Leaked details about the internal file

Note that pool_internal.h is an internal file and must not be leaked. Do not copy internal or implementation specific details.

WHY THIS IS BETTER:
Does not assume details about the similarly named function
Does not leak details about the internal file
